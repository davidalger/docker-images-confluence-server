# Confluence Server Docker Images

Confluence Server image â€“ create, organise and discuss work with your team. These images are based on the official images at [atlassian/confluence-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/atlassian/confluence-server). Currently the only addition is the available `-mysql` suffix which includes the mysql connector neccessary for running Confluence Server on MySQL 5.6 or 5.7.
